<h1>Configuring Advanced Ethernet Options</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I learned to ping a host using a PC. The ping command tests connectivity by sending packets to an IP address, expecting the device at that address to send packets back. The command sends packets, which means if you receive this packet and it is addressed to you, send a reply back.
